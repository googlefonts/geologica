<p>Geologica is grounded in the humanist genre, but leans assertively into geometric, constructed letterforms to find its stability. The wide stance, generous spacing, large apertures and even colour makes Geologica a serious text typeface. The stylistic “Sharpness” axis adds a rational interpretation of calligraphic pen strokes - a modernist echo of the roots of writing.</p>

<p>Variable axes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cursive (CRSV)</li>
<li>Sharpness (SHRP)</li>
<li>Weight (wght)</li>
<li>Slant (slnt)</li>
</ul>
