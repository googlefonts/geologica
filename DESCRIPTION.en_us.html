<p><a href="https://github.com/monokromskriftforlag/geologisk">Geologica</a> is grounded in the humanist genre, but leans assertively into geometric, constructed letterforms to find its stability. The wide stance, generous spacing, large apertures and even colour makes Geologica a serious text typeface. The stylistic “Sharp” axis adds a rational interpretation of calligraphic pen strokes – a modernist echo of the roots of writing.</p>
