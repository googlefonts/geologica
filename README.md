# Geologisk

*Geologisk* is an open source sans serif typeface. It is developed in the new OpenType variation font format and currently has three axes: weight, slant and a(n as of yet untitled) stylistic axis.

The stylistic extremes are 
* 1: Terminals cut perpendicular to the stroke angle and rectangular stems.
* 2: Terminals cut at 90 degree angles, introducing sharp details that are echoed in the diagonally sliced stems that loosely adheres to the traditional angle of broad nib calligraphy.
