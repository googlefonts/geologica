* [com.google.fonts/check/integer_ppem_if_hinted](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/integer_ppem_if_hinted)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Hinted fonts must have head table flag bit 3 set.

Per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head, bit 3 of
Head::flags decides whether PPEM should be rounded. This bit should always be
set for hinted fonts.

Note:
Bit 3 = Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math;
        May use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** This is a hinted font, so it must have bit 3 set on the flags of the head table, so that PPEM values will be rounded into an integer value.

This can be accomplished by using the 'gftools fix-hinting' command.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20
characters.

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

 FONT_FAMILY_NAME = 'Geologica Sharp Black' / SUBFAMILY_NAME = 'Regular'

Please take a look at the conversation at https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/2179 in order to understand the reasoning behind these name table records max-length criteria. [code: too-long]

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,

<pre>--- Rationale ---

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Hinted fonts must have head table flag bit 3 set.

Per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head, bit 3 of
Head::flags decides whether PPEM should be rounded. This bit should always be
set for hinted fonts.

Note:
Bit 3 = Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math;

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20
characters.

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

Hinted fonts must have head table flag bit 3 set.

Per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head, bit 3 of
Head::flags decides whether PPEM should be rounded. This bit should always be
set for hinted fonts.

Note:
Bit 3 = Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math;
        May use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** This is a hinted font, so it must have bit 3 set on the flags of the head table, so that PPEM values will be rounded into an integer value.

This can be accomplished by using the 'gftools fix-hinting' command.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20
characters.

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

Hinted fonts must have head table flag bit 3 set.

Per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head, bit 3 of
Head::flags decides whether PPEM should be rounded. This bit should always be
set for hinted fonts.

Note:
Bit 3 = Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math;
        May use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families.

On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> PPEM must be an integer on hinted fonts.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/integer_ppem_if_hinted](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/integer_ppem_if_hinted)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Hinted fonts must have head table flag bit 3 set.

Per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head, bit 3 of
Head::flags decides whether PPEM should be rounded. This bit should always be
set for hinted fonts.

Note:
Bit 3 = Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math;
        May use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** This is a hinted font, so it must have bit 3 set on the flags of the head table, so that PPEM values will be rounded into an integer value.

This can be accomplished by using the 'gftools fix-hinting' command.

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWinAscent & usWinDescent.</summary>

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2.usWinDescent value should be equal or greater than 895, but got 746 instead. [code: descent]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.
